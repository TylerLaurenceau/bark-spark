  BarkSpark is the brainchild of The Iron Yard graduates Tyler Laurenceau and Cory Vaughan. The idea arose from Earl, Cory’s 2-year-old doodle, over the amount of attention he received from everyone at the dog park. Cory thought, “how can I benefit from Earl’s laid-back personality and stunning good looks?” AND BAM! He would bring Earl’s exotic good looks online. He thought other people must have benefited from their dog’s being more attractive then themselves, and after scouring the internet in search of a dating site for dog owner’s with no results he knew he had something. With the idea in mind, he sought out a partner that would be able to bring his idea to life. In stepped Tyler. Tyler’s expertise when it comes to all things frontend was a sure bet and they embarked on the long journey to demo day. Through long days that turned into night and all of the weekends in between, they finally did it. So enjoy your site and go meet up with you match at a local dog-friendly estashblishment!
